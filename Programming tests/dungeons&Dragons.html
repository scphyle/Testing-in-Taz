               <!-- Update as campaign goes on    -->
               Last time on The Journey into the Unknown, our adventurers found themselves returning to the people of Phandelin after defeating most of the local thugs known as the Red Brands. The party recieved a few strange new quests to help the people of Phandelin in hopes of restoring their reputation. They returned desparately needed supplies to the townmaster, after distributing some food to the starving villagers. Gobby has decided to remain with the group for the time being and is completely flabbergasted now that he has reentered society. Will the party stay the course and continue to help the people of Phandelin? Will they ever find Rockseeker? Is Iarno really Glassstaff? Tune in next time to find out!
